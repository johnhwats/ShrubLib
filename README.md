# ShrubLib

Public development of a library for a version control system called "Shrub".

(Although I am considering calling it by its anagram "Brush" because there's less of
a negative connotation.)

A "shrub" is a tree without without a trunk. Branches fan out and are not merged
back into a trunk. The idea is that programming or creative writing pathfinds into 
the unknown, the nebulous, and the dark. In order to find a way or methodology where it 
did not exist before. We are explorers cutting across jungle moreso than a
traditional engineer with a laid out plan, with a design, or with an architecture.
