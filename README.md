# ShrubLib

Public development of a library for a version control system called "Shrub".

(Although I am considering calling it by its anagram "Brush" because there's less of
a negative connotation.)

A "shrub" is a tree without a trunk. Branches fan out and are not merged
back into a trunk. The idea is that programming or creative writing pathfinds into 
the unknown, the nebulous, and the dark. In order to find a way or methodology where it 
did not exist before. We are explorers cutting across jungle, moreso than a
traditional engineer with a laid out plan, with a design, or even with an architecture.

In order to explore, we need to be lightweight but not physically with less gear like 
in an outdoor camping adventure, rather as keyboard warriors, we need to be lightweight mentally. 
The tools we use should be essential and lightweight as possible.

In "shrub", branching is done automatically with each commit. At each commit, the parent
branch does not need to be specified because the parent branch is found by "shrub"
by optimally locating the parent branch in terms of space and speed considerations. Thus, 
there is no need for the user to branch at all, and when he commits, it's just the press 
of a button. What emerges is a development tree that grows organically and holds in
itself insights into the history of the development process by way of its shape.
